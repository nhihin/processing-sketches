This sketch features a central, non-moving circle with 2 (or more) circles orbiting around it. 
In this example, there are two orbiting circles. 
Subsequent circles are made to be smaller and faster. 
The process has been mostly adapted from my spirograph example. 
I also played around with generating colours with the `random()` function. 
Because the colours are specified in RGB format, setting the R and B to constant values (in this case, R = 50 and B = 240) while letting G vary from 80 to 200 
allowed variation of the colour of the central circle ('Earth') between teal and blue.
