# 2 - Satellites

A simple animation of two moons orbiting a planet. 

1. Set angle to 0.
2. Draw three circles using a `for` loop to gradually decrease the size of the circle and increase its displacement along the y-axis (to make the moons increasingly further away from the central planet). The first circle (the planet) has the largest radius (150 units), the second circle (moon 1) has a radius of 100 units, and the last circle (moon 2) has a radius of 50 units. 
3. Increment angle by 1, clear the background (to prevent a continuous streak of moon) and repeat step 2. 
4. Just for fun, using the `random()` function, the colour of the central planet changes colour from blue to teal and back again.
